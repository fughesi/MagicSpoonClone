          respond to allegations of copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the
          “DMCA”). Under the DMCA, a copyright owner may file a takedown notice with an online service provider of an
          alleged copyright infringement. During this process, the service provider responds by taking down the alleged
          infringing content, and takes reasonable steps to contact the owner of the removed content so that a
          counter-notification may be filed, if appropriate. If a valid counter-notification is filed, we typically will
          restore the content in question, unless we receive notice from the notification provider that a legal action
          has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the infringing
          activity. We may provide copies of such notices to the affected parties or to any other third parties, at our
          discretion and as required by law. Our Privacy Notice does not apply to any information contained in these

            We will promptly provide the party that provided the notice of alleged infringement with a copy of the
            counter-notification, and inform the complaining party that we intend to restore the removed or disabled
            content within ten (10) business days. If we do not receive notice that a lawsuit has been filed within ten
            (10) business days after we provide notice of the counter-notification, we will restore the removed or
            disabled content. Until that time, your content will remain removed or disabled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice of alleged infringement must be sent by electronic mail to our DMCA Agent, Magic Spoon Inc, at

          Before filing a notice of copyright infringement, you must make a careful determination as to whether or not
          the use of the material at issue is or may be protected by the “fair use” doctrine. You could potentially be
          held liable for costs and attorneys’ fees should you file a takedown notice where there is no infringing use.
          If you are unsure whether there is infringement, it may be advisable to seek legal counsel.

            You agree that any dispute between you and Magic Spoon arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
            Products, Programs or Web Properties (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration
            procedure outlined below.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="TermsUL"> Governing law</span>. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the terms
            of service and the resolution of any disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
            of the State of Delaware without regard to its conflict of laws principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="TermsUL">Informal dispute resolution</span>. We want to address your concerns without the
            need for legal proceedings. Before filing a claim against Magic Spoon, you agree to try to resolve the
            dispute informally by contacting support@Magic Spoon.com. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by
            contacting you by email. If a dispute is not resolved within 45 days after such email submission, you or
            Magic Spoon may bring a formal arbitration proceeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="TermsUL">Agreement to arbitrate</span>. You and Magic Spoon agree to resolve any disputes
            through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth in the exceptions to arbitrate below.

            administer the arbitration under its commercial arbitration rules and the supplementary procedures for
            consumer related disputes. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work,
            or any other location we agree to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="TermsUL">Arbitration fees</span>. The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration
            fees. Magic Spoon will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $5,000. Magic Spoon will not seek its
            attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="TermsUL"> Exceptions to agreement to arbitrate</span>. Either you or Magic Spoon may assert
            claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in any United States county where you live or work. Either
            party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Magic Spoon
            Products or Web Properties, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade
            secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution

            Spoon agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in an appropriate
            court in Delaware. Both you and Magic Spoon consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree
            to waive our right to a jury trial.

        Program Dispute Resolution: In the event that there is a dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Magic
        Spoon, or between you and Stodge, LLC d/b/a Postscript or any other third-party service provider acting on Our
        behalf to transmit the mobile messages within the scope of the Program, arising out of or relating to federal or
        state statutory claims, common law claims, this Agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement,
        interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement
        to arbitrate, such dispute, claim, or controversy will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, determined by
        arbitration in New York, NY before one arbitrator.
        <p>
          The parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
          Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
          arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the Federal Judicial Circuit in which Magic Spoon Inc.’s
          principle place of business is located, without regard to its conflict of laws rules. Within ten (10) calendar
          days after the arbitration demand is served upon a party, the parties must jointly select an arbitrator with
          at least five years’ experience in that capacity and who has knowledge of and experience with the subject
          matter of the dispute. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) calendar days, a party may
          petition the AAA to appoint an arbitrator, who must satisfy the same experience requirement. In the event of a
          dispute, the arbitrator shall decide the enforceability and interpretation of this arbitration agreement in
          accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). The parties also agree that the AAA’s rules governing
          Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply in lieu of seeking emergency injunctive relief from a court. The
          decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, and no party shall have rights of appeal except for
          those provided in section 10 of the FAA. Each party shall bear its share of the fees paid for the arbitrator
          and the administration of the arbitration; however, the arbitrator shall have the power to order one party to
          pay all or any portion of such fees as part of a well-reasoned decision. The parties agree that the arbitrator
          shall have the authority to award attorneys’ fees only to the extent expressly authorized by statute or
          contract. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages and each party hereby waives any
          right to seek or recover punitive damages with respect to any dispute resolved by arbitration. The parties
          agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and this agreement does not permit class arbitration or any
          claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding. Except as
          may be required by law, neither a party nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of
          any arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties, unless to protect or pursue a legal right.
          If any term or provision of this Section is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
          invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Section or
          invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other jurisdiction. If for any reason a
          dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the parties hereby waive any right to a jury trial. This
          arbitration provision shall survive any cancellation or termination of your agreement to participate in any of
          our Programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent to Us that you have all necessary rights, power, and authority to
          agree to these Terms and perform your obligations hereunder, and nothing contained in this Agreement or in the
          performance of such obligations will place you in breach of any other contract or obligation. The failure of
          either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein will not be deemed a waiver of any
          further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that
          provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise
          remain in full force and effect and enforceable. Any new features, changes, updates or improvements of the
          Program shall be subject to this Agreement unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing. We reserve the right
          to change this Agreement from time to time. Any updates to this Agreement shall be communicated to you. You
          acknowledge your responsibility to review this Agreement from time to time and to be aware of any such
          changes. By continuing to participate in the Program after any such changes, you accept this Agreement, as
          modified.
